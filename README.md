# Museum-Generous-Interface
Final year project 

An interface built using React, integrating the Victoria & Albert museum API in order to display museum artefacts inside an interactive world map, based on their location of origin.

This project has been designed as an alternative to the current search interfaces that dominate digitaal cultural heritage websites.
